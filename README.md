# Week 8 HW: Typescript Car Cli app

## Description

This fun car application taught me how to use Typescript, as well as exercise use of Node.JS, to create a kind of simulator for cars, trucks, and motorbikes. 
Writing this challenge gave me expierience in for-loops, callbacks, if else statements, arrays and classes in typescript, and launching applications through npm and Node.
My biggest challenge was figuring out how to call the tow and wheelie actions in the instance of certain types of vehicles in the array.
